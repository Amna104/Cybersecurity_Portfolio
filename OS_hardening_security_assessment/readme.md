# OS Hardening & Security Risk Assessment

## Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to conduct OS hardening, respond to security incidents, and perform a detailed risk assessment. It includes identifying vulnerabilities, documenting incidents, and recommending remediations to improve organizational security.

## Incident Summary
- Investigated a malicious file download affecting users visiting yummyrecipesforme.com.
- Used sandbox environments and tcpdump to analyze network traffic.
- Identified brute force attacks on administrator accounts and malicious payload execution.

## Hardening Measures & Recommendations
1. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to protect accounts from brute force attacks.
2. Set and enforce strong password policies to improve access control.
3. Perform regular firewall maintenance to prevent unauthorized traffic and DoS/DDoS attacks.

## Skills Applied
- Network protocol analysis (HTTP)
- Security incident documentation
- OS hardening techniques
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- NIST CSF framework application
