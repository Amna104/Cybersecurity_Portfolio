# NIST CSF Incident Response Portfolio Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to respond to a security incident using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). The activity involved analyzing a simulated security incident, applying the NIST CSF steps, and documenting the response process.

## Scope
- Identify and assess the security incident
- Apply NIST CSF functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover
- Provide detailed documentation of actions taken and findings

## Tools & Techniques
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- Incident response procedures
- Security monitoring and log analysis

## Key Achievements
- Completed a full incident response simulation
- Applied security controls and best practices according to NIST CSF
- Documented response and recovery actions for a simulated security event

## Skills Applied
- Threat detection and incident response
- Compliance with NIST CSF
- Documentation and reporting
