## 1. System Description
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU and 128GB of memory. It runs the latest version of Linux and hosts a MySQL database management system. The system has a stable network connection (IPv4) and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

---

## 2. Scope
The assessment focuses on the current access controls of the system. The assessment period covers three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 guided the risk analysis of this information system.

---

## 3. Purpose
The database server stores customer, campaign, and analytic data. This data is used to track marketing performance and personalize campaigns. Securing the server is critical due to its central role in marketing operations.

## 4. Risk Assessment

| Threat Source | Threat Event | Likelihood (1-3) | Severity (1-3) | Risk (LxS) |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|
| Hacker        | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration | 3 | 3 | 9 |
| Employee      | Disrupt mission-critical operations | 2 | 3 | 6 |
| Customer      | Alter/Delete critical information | 1 | 3 | 3 |

**Approach:**  
Risk evaluation considered data storage and management practices. Threat sources and events were determined based on likelihood of security incidents given open access permissions. Severity was weighed against operational impact.

---

## 5. Remediation Strategy
- Implement authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms.  
- Use strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit privileges.  
- Encrypt data in motion using TLS instead of SSL.  
- IP allow-list corporate offices to prevent unauthorized internet access.

## Key Takeaways
This assessment demonstrates the importance of proactive security measures, risk quantification, and remediation planning for critical systems.
